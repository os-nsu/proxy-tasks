    \brief Logger dynamic library interface
    \version 1.0
    \date 15 Jan 2025

    This file contains logger's function signatures.

    Logger is the singleton. Therefore double init_logger must return -1.
    
    Logger must be able to write messages in some output streams that 
    enumerates in OutputStream enumeration:

    1) STDOUT
    2) STDERR - standard stream for logging. Logger must use this stream 
    if chosen stream not available.
    3) FILE - logger is able to use this stream if parameter path in 
    init_logger call is not NULL. There are log files in chosen directory.
    Their names obey next rule: "proxyN.log", where N is order number of file.
    If all available log files are filled, then logger starts overwrite them
    from first.
